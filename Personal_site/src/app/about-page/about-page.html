              <p> 
I’m an indie developer and full-stack engineer with a systems-thinking mindset 
 and hands-on fluency in Angular, ASP.NET Core, and DevOps automation. I specialize in building scalable web applications with responsive UI  layouts, clean CRUD logic, and  seamless API integration.
My journey began at Tshwane University of Technology, where I earned a National Diploma in Computer Systems Engineering. That program taught me more than just code — it taught me how to think in systems, connect layers, and solve problems from the ground up.
After graduating, I joined Clientele Limited as a full-stack developer, supporting live production systems across UI, backend, and database layers. I resolved bugs, optimized performance, and collaborated with teams to improve user experience.<br><br> Later, I worked as an IT technician at Tshwane South College, troubleshooting networks, fixing lab setups, and supporting both students and staff.
I’m now expanding into cybersecurity and indie development — blending secure systems thinking with creative freedom. I’ve earned certifications in web design, Angular/ASP.NET development, CompTIA A+, and Git, and I’m actively building projects that reflect both technical depth and personal vision.

Because every challenge is an opportunity to grow.</p>
