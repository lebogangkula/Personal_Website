    <p> 
I’m an indie developer and full-stack engineer with a systems-thinking mindset 
 and hands-on<br> fluency in Angular, ASP.NET Core, and DevOps automation. I specialize in building scalable<br> web applications with responsive UI  layouts, clean CRUD logic, and  seamless API integration.<br>
My journey began at Tshwane University of Technology, where I earned a National Diploma in<br> Computer Systems Engineering. That program taught me more than just code — it taught me how <br>to think in systems, connect layers, and solve problems from the ground up.
After graduating, I joined<br> Clientele Limited as a full-stack developer, supporting live production systems across UI, backend, and database layers.<br>I resolved bugs, optimized performance, and collaborated with teams to improve user experience.<br><br> Later, I worked as an IT technician at Tshwane South College, troubleshooting networks, fixing lab setups, <br>and supporting both students and staff.
I’m now expanding into cybersecurity and indie development — blending<br> secure systems thinking with creative freedom. I’ve earned certifications in web design, Angular/ASP.NET development,<br> CompTIA A+, and Git, and I’m actively building projects that reflect both technical depth and personal vision.<br>

<p >I live by the motto:

<br>
Because every challenge is an opportunity to grow.</p>
